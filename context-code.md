```python
import streamlit as st
import openai
import pdfplumber

openai.api_key = "YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY"

def extract_resume_text(uploaded_file):
    with pdfplumber.open(uploaded_file) as pdf:
        return "\n".join(page.extract_text() for page in pdf.pages if page.extract_text())

def analyze_resume(text):
    response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
        model="gpt-4-turbo",
        messages=[{"role": "system", "content": "Extract skills, experience, and education from the following resume:\n" + text}]
    )
    return response["choices"][0]["message"]["content"]

st.title("Resume Analyzer")
uploaded_file = st.file_uploader("Upload your resume (PDF)", type="pdf")
if uploaded_file:
    resume_text = extract_resume_text(uploaded_file)

        app_id = os.getenv('ADZUNA_APP_ID')
        api_key = os.getenv('ADZUNA_API_KEY')
        url = f"http://api.adzuna.com/v1/api/jobs/us/search/1?app_id={app_id}&app_key={api_key}&results_per_page={num_results}&what={role}&where={location}&content-type=application/json"

        response = requests.get(url)
        jobs_data = response.json()
        return [
            f"Title: {job['title']}, Company: {job['company']['display_name']}, Location: {job['location']['display_name']}"
